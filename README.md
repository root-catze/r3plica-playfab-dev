# r3plica-playfab-dev
You can find more information about these and other APIs in the PlayFab API documentation:

[https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/](https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/)

r3plica only used a very limited subset of PlayFab's features, not everything.

For example, r3plica used PlayFab to create and manage users in a Unity game, and defined custom functions such as CloudScript to access data requested from a separate server to the game server.

In addition, r3plica used PlayFab to handle user authentication and other parts for convenience, rather than managing them on a separate server. Of course, you can reduce the dependence on PlayFab for better service. r3plica used PlayFab to handle user authentication and other parts for convenience, rather than managing them on a separate server.
